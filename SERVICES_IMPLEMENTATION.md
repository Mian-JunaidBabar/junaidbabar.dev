import { NewIcon } from "lucide-react";

{
  title: "Your New Service",
  slug: "your-new-service",
  icon: NewIcon,
  shortDesc: "Brief description for the card",
  fullDesc: "Full description for the detail page",
  tags: ["Tool1", "Tool2", "Tool3"],
  skills: [
    "Skill description 1",
    "Skill description 2",
    // ... add 6-8 skills
  ],
  relatedProjects: ["keyword1", "keyword2"],
}
```

The new service will automatically appear in:

- Services grid on main page
- New route: `/services/your-new-service`

## 📊 Project Matching Logic

The system automatically finds related projects by:

1. Taking `relatedProjects` keywords from service
2. Comparing with `keywords` array in resume.json projects
3. Matching case-insensitively
4. Displaying up to 6 matched projects

**Example:**

```typescript
// Service definition
relatedProjects: ["Next.js", "React", "web"]

// Will match projects with keywords like:
keywords: ["Next.js", "React", "TypeScript"] ✅
keywords: ["React", "Web Development"]       ✅
keywords: ["Python", "Flask"]                 ❌
```
